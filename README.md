TODO
----

- [ ] Add mix tasks and documentation to README
    - [ ] Fetch the puzzle text/story for a given day
        - Make sure it's not committed, it should be in the git ignore
        - Needs authentication, puzzles are revealed only as they're solved
    - [ ] Fetch the puzzle "input" as a text file
        - Use the same auth
        - Again can't be committed to the repository
